# bootstrapping

In this repository you can find codes to run spatial bootstrap. Details of procedure were desribed in a paper by Katarzyna Kopczewska on "Spatial bootstrapped microeconometrics forecasting for out-of-sample geo-locations in big data", published in Scandinavian Journal of Statistics (2023).

Files to replicate the model are very basic: contours of NTS2 regions in shapefile and geo-located point data in csv. Analysis was done on Lubelskie region (Poland). Data on firms are the examples of ca. 37 000 business locations in Lubelskie region in 2012. They are also available from: https://app.sugarsync.com/iris/wf/D1836703_09668593_7523727

To speed up the replications of all figures and analyses, you can also download the simulation files, which are exectured within this analysis. They are available from: https://app.sugarsync.com/iris/wf/D1836703_09668593_7523736

Good luck!
